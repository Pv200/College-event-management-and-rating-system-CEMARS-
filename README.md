## Overview 
This Project is made for improvizing the Event Management in colleges and developing the feeling of competitiveness among the college clubs.
In this Project I have implemented the user feedback system for a particular project in which we collect the data from the user and do sentimental analysis on that data and generate the ranking for the organizing among the all other clubs.

Then I have also integrated the Advance attendance system in which the registered users will be putted present or absent on the basis of there availability.
Here Blog posting system also there in which an admin will post the blog for the happening events and which are displayed on the user side.

Login/signup system is also present for both admin/user.

Detailed analysis is also been generated for every event by fetching the details for each and every student from the backend.
